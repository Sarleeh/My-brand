       MY BRAND FROM IT'S CRADLE,
        Of course every little achievement has a story behind it and here's for my brand.
        It all started in my second year in tetiary institution, I had learnt to bake even before my first year so yeah i had the basic knowledge and all that i needed was the certainty and time balance most importantly because it was seeming my academics were becoming really demanding that i don't see myself making out time for something else asides school.
        On a particular day my friends stopped by my room in the hostel and i didn't have anything to offer them but i had few ingredients i brought from home then it struck my mind to bake them a cake and ofcourse with pot and stove then!
        Interesting right?
        Well,yes my school authorities wouldn't allow the use of gas,so yeah i was using stove in my second year.
        I baked chocolate cake and the entire aroma was all over the floor.
        After the cake was out, I shared it with my friends and our neighbors.
        They dropped their reviews and my friends as well,then our neighbors asked me the next day that was there still cake available?
        I said no,i only baked that day for my friends and here response was "please commercialize it we'll definitely patronize, it really tasted nice "
        I explained to them that i couldn't merge business with school and all of that but ofcourse there were many other vendors that were students too and the balance was just all that matters.
        My friends said the same too.
        I started with baking cupcakes and cake slices gradually,i started receiving orders from neighbors and coursemates.
        I grew gradually, my circle of clients changed from just friends,coursemates and neighbors to even random people inclusive.
        In my third year,our school accepted the use of gas cylinders then i transitioned from baking with kerosene to baking with gas.
        PS:Not a gas oven,but a 3kg gas cylinder with a pot.
        I continued this way,juggling business,school and other activities.
        I grew gradually,till i was able to purchase an industrial oven that would bake in considerable quantities for me than batch baking i had been doing all of this time . 
        I worked on better lighting for my pictures too and got a ringlight.
        I also went for trade exhibition out of fear put all that i had out there and definitely a diffrence was made.
        All of these were in my fourth year!
        To cut all of my story breif not short, All i can say is ALHAMDULILLAH because 
        Sometimes i wished i started earlier because By ALLAH'S WILL, these tentacles have stretched beyond zaria and its evirons.

        I Would love you see more about my brand and also indulge in some of our delightful pieces we have for you in the information below.
